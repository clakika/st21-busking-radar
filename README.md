What is Busking Radar?

Busking Radar is an app that makes outdoor live entertainment easily discoverable for any user and helps buskers draw a larger audience to their performances. 

Here's some background:

Why build such an app? 

Street performances are a way for artists to earn some income & build a fanbase. This app would allow a day to day opportunity for the buskers to attract an audience.
From the fans point of view, street performances are a way to see live entertainment for free. With this app, we make live street performance easily discoverable. 

What is the motivation?

This app could help support a valuable cultural trait (street performance) and allow it to thrive. 
During the pandemic, street performances are one of the few cultural activities, which people can experience. The app could help the public find out about those performances.

What user problems are you attempting to solve?

Connecting users to outdoor live entertainment. 
Provide buskers with the information about city regulations concerning street music performances (This is something that we later included as our Post MVP)
Allow users to access a "library" of public events with all the necessary information in just one app (ex. type of live entertainment, time, number of users participating at the event, rating of the performer (Post MVP) etc.)

What's our goal?

Our GOAL is to create a platform with a user-friendly interface, which would make outdoor live entertainment easily discoverable for any user and in this way help buskers to draw a larger audience to their performances.

What's NOT our goal?

What we do NOT want to do is not to create a social network for buskers and fans. The main focus should be on performances and their "advertisement" (ways that buskers can promote their live performances). 

Usability: 

How can I use the app? 
If you are a busker, we recommend you to sign up for Busking Radar and create a profile, in order to access all the benefits that we offer for the buskers. 
When you register, you will have the possibility to create events with the interactive map and let people know about your performances!
If you are a fan, we currently advise you to "Enter as a guest", in order to see all the events happening near your location. Our future plans include the fan to be able to sign up as a "FAN" and thus be able to favourite artists and get notifications on future events.
